title: "Trust Through Transparency: Why Menstrudel is Open Source"

Apps make bold claims about privacy, we wanted to do more than just make a promise. We wanted to provide proof. That's why we made the decision to build Menstrudel as a fully **open-source** project.

But what does that actually mean for you?

### "Don't Trust, Verify"

The term "open source" means that our entire source code—the blueprint for how the app works—is publicly available for anyone to see, inspect, and audit.

Think of it like the difference between a secret recipe and one that's published in a cookbook. With a secret recipe, you just have to trust that the ingredients are what the chef says they are. With a published recipe, you can go into the kitchen and see for yourself.

Our code is our recipe. By making it public on platforms like GitHub, we are giving our users, and the entire developer community, the ability to verify our claims.



### Why This Matters for a Privacy App

For an app that handles your sensitive health data, transparency is everything. Being open source is our commitment to you that:

* **We Have Nothing to Hide:** You can see for yourself that we have no trackers, no analytics, and no code that sends your personal data anywhere. Our claims of being "offline-first" aren't just a marketing slogan; they are a verifiable fact written in the code.
* **Community-Powered Security:** With more eyes on the code, potential security flaws can be found and fixed by a global community of developers. It's a collaborative approach to making the app safer for everyone.
* **You Are in Control:** You don't have to blindly trust us. You have the power to see exactly how the app functions, ensuring that it aligns with your expectations for privacy and security.

### Join Us on the Journey

Menstrudel is more than just an app; it's a community-driven project built on trust. We invite you to explore our code, suggest improvements, or even contribute to the project.

By choosing an open-source app, you're not just downloading a tool; you're supporting a movement towards a more transparent and trustworthy digital world.
