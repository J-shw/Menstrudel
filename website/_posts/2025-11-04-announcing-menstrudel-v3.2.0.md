We're excited to release version **3.2.0** of Menstrudel. This update includes several new features requested by the community and important bug fixes.

## Get the Menstrudel App

- 🤖 [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.whitticase.menstrudel)
- 🍎 [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/menstrudel/id6751970511)


### What's New
* **Custom Symptoms** Thanks to the hard work of a new contributor, we now have custom symptoms! There are default ones provided, but users can now create and log their own symptoms. Go to settings > Logging
* **Hide Pill Screen** You can now hide the pill screen from the navbar! Go to settings > Birth control and enable/disable 'Enable Pill Tracking'.
* **Android Widget** We have our first widget! It's only for Android at the moment, and shows the estimated date of your next period.
* **Pain Level Now Optional** Thanks to user feedback, pain level is optional and not selected by default when logging. (We also added some more colour to the indicators 🌈)
* **More Translations** Thanks to the community, the app now has better translation support!
