### What's New
* **New Logo** That's right, we have a new logo! We are trying to make a bit more of a brand for ourselves.

* **LARC Tracking** LARCs or Long-Acting Reversible Contraception can now be logged and have reminders set for when they need to be renewed.

* **More Translations** Thanks to the community, the app now has better translation support!

Check out our new look! We think this logo is more modern and adds personality to the app. Based on user feedback, we came up with this design and hope you love it as much as we do!

We are expanding our birth control tracking! You can now log **Long-Acting Reversible Contraception (LARCs)**—highly effective methods like IUDs and implants that last for years—and set renewal reminders.

Logging LARC usage is simple and quick. If notifications are enabled, you'll get a reminder for renewal.
