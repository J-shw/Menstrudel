We're excited to release version **3.3.0** of Menstrudel. We have a new app logo, LARC tracking and some general bug fixes.

## Get the Menstrudel App

- 🤖 [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.whitticase.menstrudel)
- 🍎 [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/menstrudel/id6751970511)


### What's New
* **New Logo** That's right, we have a new logo! We are trying to make a bit more of a brand for ourselves. To better get users and contributers onboard.

* **LARC Tracking** LARCs or Long-Acting Reversible Contraception can now be logged and have reminders set for when they need to be renewed.

* **More Translations** Thanks to the community, the app now has better translation support!


<h3 style="text-align: center;">Custom Symptoms </h3>

Thats right, you can now log any and every symptom you want! This has been one of our most requested features since starting. We know symptoms are unique and affect everyone differently, so this feature gives you the freedom to log them all.

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Introducing Android Widgets!</h3>

We're excited to release our first widget, **starting with Android**! It shows the estimated start date of your next period using the same circular progress bar you know from the app.

This is just the beginning, and we plan to improve it and add more options based on your feedback.

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Hide the Pill Screen</h3>

We know not all of our users need pill tracking. If you don't use this feature, you can now remove it from the navigation bar completely.

Just go to **Settings > Birth Control** and disable the 'Enable Pill Tracking' toggle.
